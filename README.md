# SillyTavernShortcut
Running SillyTavern can be a little bit overwhelming for some people. This is a shortcut that essentially gets the ball rolling as soon as you get your AI backend running.

**This is for [SillyTavern](https://github.com/Cohee1207/SillyTavern). In order to use this, you'll have to set up the project itself first. It's also advisable that you take a look at the [Extra Modules](https://github.com/Cohee1207/SillyTavern-extras) since there's a general how-to to run the project.**

**This requires miniconda, which is [option 1](https://github.com/Cohee1207/SillyTavern-extras) in the how-to guide of Extra Modules.**

This is a command prompt shortcut that calls miniconda and enters all the prompts needed to run the essential [Extra Modules](https://github.com/Cohee1207/SillyTavern-extras#modules) for SillyTavern on its own, saving a good bit of time for the user. It is theoretically easily configurable to the user, but it will run the general things needed to enjoy what you can with SillyTavern and TavernAI.

You can download **[here](https://github.com/GrandeaGTR/SillyTavernShortcut/releases/tag/Release)** or in the releases tab on the right side of the page.
